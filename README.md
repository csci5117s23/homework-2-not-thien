## Notes to Grader: 
currently, checkboxes are a little buggy and will be checked but don't appear as such. Also, after adding a new task, you have to wait a few seconds before clicking into the task. My code has issues with efficiently leveraging React states and efficiently updating the frontend.

Also, sorry for the ugly CSS.
